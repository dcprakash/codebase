0. create dict_t of all unique chars in t; len of this is required number of chars
1. left and right pointer pointing to 0
2. keep moving right pointer until window has all elements
3. increment left pointer, check if windows has all elements, if so capture min window
4. if incrementing left pointer dont have char in windows, increment right again
