    helper row, col: helps to keep track of "count and location" of 1's in matrix
    DFS/ BFS visited: 
        seen = set() 
        visited=[0]*N
        visited=[[for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]

Array:
    target sum: 4-subarray-sum-minimum-size, 4-subarray-with-given-sum
    maintain sorted list: heapq (minimum-meeting_rooms)
    queue to popleft: deque (findisland-rotting-oranges)
    
    
String:
    ord(c)  -   to convert strint to integer
    <number>*10 -   to convert string to number (first digit is 0, then actual number)

zip:
    parallel iteration https://realpython.com/python-zip-function/
    Pythonâ€™s zip() function is defined as zip(*iterables). 
    The function takes in iterables as arguments and returns an iterator. 
    This iterator generates a series of tuples containing elements from each iterable.
    zip() can accept any type of iterable, such as files, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and so on.
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    letters = ['a', 'b']
    zipped = zip(numbers, letters)
    print(list(zipped))  
    # [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]
    # output will be equal to the length of the shortest iterable.
    
    # unzip along with the unpacking operator *
    pairs = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]
    numbers, letters = zip(*pairs)
    print(numbers)
    # (1, 2, 3, 4)
    print(letters)
    # ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
