2-D:
    helper row, col: helps to keep track of "count and location" of 1's in matrix
    DFS/ BFS visited: 
        seen = set() 
        visited=[0]*N
        visited=[[for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]

    Good examples:
        find-islands-maxarea
        maximal_square
    
    
    
Array:
    target sum: 4-subarray-sum-minimum-size, 4-subarray-with-given-sum
    maintain sorted list: heapq (minimum-meeting_rooms)
    queue to popleft: deque (findisland-rotting-oranges)
    
    
String:
    ord(c)  -   to convert strint to integer
    <number>*10 -   to convert string to number (first digit is 0, then actual number)
